      "introduction": "I graduated from the Faculty of Information Science at Hosei University. \nAfter that, I have worked at a IT company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a venture SES company, and TeamLab. Currently, I am actively working as a SaaS engineer at a venture company. Additionally, I also provide web development support as a subcontractor (with a track record of 3 companies). I enjoy creating things that others find interesting. My hobbies include playing musical instruments (drums, bass, guitar), attending music live performances, going to the gym, and traveling alone.\nI am creating and managing the <a href='https://twitter.com/mrpricer_app?s=20' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' style='text-decoration: underline;'>'Mr. Pricer'</a> app, a form generation application for estimates."
