      "introduction": "I graduated from the Faculty of Information Science at Hosei University. \nAfter that, I have worked at a IT company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a venture SES company, and TeamLab. Currently, I am actively working as a SaaS engineer at Basic. Additionally, I also provide web development support as a subcontractor (with a track record of 3 companies). I enjoy creating things that others find interesting. My hobbies include playing musical instruments (drums, bass, guitar), attending music live performances, going to the gym, and traveling alone."
